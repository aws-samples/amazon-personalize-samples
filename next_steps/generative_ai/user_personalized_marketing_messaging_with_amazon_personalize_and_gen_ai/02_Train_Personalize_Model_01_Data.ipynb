    "[Amazon Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/personalize/) is a fully managed Machine Learning (ML) service that uses your data to generate item recommendations for your users. Amazon Personalize makes it easy for developers to build applications with a wide array of personalization use cases and automates many of the complicated steps to build, train, and deploy a ML model.  \n",

The best interaction data for use for Amazon Personalize would include the sequential order of user beavior, what content was watched/clicked on and the order it was interacted with. To simulate our interaction data, we will be using data from the [MovieLens project](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). Movielens offers multiple versions of their dataset, for the purposes of this workshop we will be using the reduced version of this dataset (approx 100,000 ratings and 3,600 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users). \n",
