There will be no Contempt of Congress brought forward against the I.R.S.. There will be no firing or arrest of Eric Holder. Obama is still slicker than Teflon¬Æ because he is not our President. Other people run the country. Think Valerie Jarrett (monster Muslim), Bilderberg. The U.N., Massive corporations that Teddy Roosevelt got rid of way back in the day yet, they came to life again like the ‚Äúcreepin‚Äô crud.‚Äù And of course Wall Street and the World Banks. In essence ladies and gentlemen we are Royally Gacked which means the inevitable will happen as T. Jefferson said. We will reset this mess with a full blown, good ole‚Äô fashioned 21st Century Civil War. Or of course we can all go sit in a FEMA camp whining about the food and missing The Facebook. We suck and blow if we let Congress drag this garbage out even one more day! Can you tell I‚Äôm ticked yet?
 By the way, anything less than arresting and prosecuting Obama will not work. Impeachment will die in the Marxist controlled Senate. Recall Bill Clinton? Wrist slap and a pat on the back!!!

"Of course! I'm actually glad you asked, was pretty ticked off seeing my comment being downvoted with no reason and no one arguing why; anyways here I go.
 
 
 
 People often cite titanic hydra as a must buy for shyvana, but I argue it's only a good item situationally, and a pretty late buy. The reasons for that is that while we call ""AD Shyvana"" ""AD"", it should really be ""Attack speed shyvana"", as most of her damage comes from her E passive. Titanic Hydra costs 3.3k gold while providing no attack speed, this already means that you can't buy it until your 3rd item (which is already pretty late). The stats are pretty nice, HP is really good on shyvana since she has high base resistances on top of her passive. However, as I mentioned previously, AD is nice but doesn't do a whole lot for her (which is why PtA is better 95% of the time over Conq). A good reason to buy titanic hydra would be for wave/jungle clear, but with W maxed out you already melt waves and jungle camps. The on-hit is nice on paper, but often feels lackluster in practice. In my opinion, if you want survivability you should get Athanema's, steraks or a tank item. Hell, I might even Black Cleaver higher just because of the movespeed. I'd rate Demonic Embrace even higher than titanic if it gave a little less AP and more HP. Now I haven't tested the item (titanic) a lot, I tried it maybe a dozen times and every time it felt lackluster for a 3.3k item so I kinda discarded it. I might need to try it again to make myself a more recent opinion.
 
 
 
 tl;dr: 3.3k item so high expectations, HP is very nice on shyvana but AD is whatever. On-hit effect nice on paper but negligible when comparing to other options (notably botrk and wit's end). Cleave passive borderline useless. I'd only get this item as a 3rd+ item but at that point I feel like there are better options depending on what you built previously.",compliance
