    "# Including promoted items in recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through an example of using promotions in [Amazon Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/) to ensure the results for a recommender contain specific items that you want users to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "Personalized recommendations increase user engagement with your websites or apps, but often there are additional business rules you want to apply when deciding what items you want to present to your users.  [Amazon Personalize promotions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/promoting-items.html) can help when you want a portion of the items presented to users to be from specific categories.  For example, a video on demand app may want to include promotions for new shows or an ecommerce website might want to include sale items in reommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![promotions-overview.png](images/promotions-overview.png \"Diagram showing how promotions changes the result of recommended items\")\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll follow the steps to build a Domain dataset group and a recommender that returns product recommendations based on synthetic data generated for a fictitious retail store data set. The goal is to recommend products that are relevant for each particular user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we'll create a promotions filter to ensure that certain promoted items are present in the recommended items for each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll cleanup all of the resources we created so we avoid incurring costs for resources that are no longer being used.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated time to run through this notebook is about 40 minutes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is broken up into cells like the one below. There's a triangular Run button at the top of this page that you can click to execute each cell and move onto the next, or you can press `Shift` + `Enter` while in the cell to execute it and move onto the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a cell is executing you'll notice a line to the side showcase an `*` while the cell is running or it will update to a number to indicate the last cell that completed executing after it has finished exectuting all the code within a cell.\n",

    "## Introduction to Amazon Personalize\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/) makes it easy for customers to develop applications with a wide array of personalization use cases, including real time product recommendations and customized direct marketing. Amazon Personalize brings the same machine learning technology used by Amazon.com to everyone for use in their applications – with no machine learning experience required. Amazon Personalize customers pay for what they use, with no minimum fees or upfront commitment. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can start using Amazon Personalize with a simple three step process, which only takes a few clicks in the AWS console, or a set of simple API calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, point Amazon Personalize to user data, catalog data, and activity stream of views, clicks, purchases, etc. in Amazon S3 or upload using a simple API call. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, with a single click in the console or an API call, train a private recommendation model for your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, retrieve personalized recommendations for any user by creating a recommender, and using the GetRecommendations API.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with Amazon Personalize, you can learn more about the service on by looking at [Github Sample Notebooks](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-personalize-samples) and [Product Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/what-is-personalize.html)."
