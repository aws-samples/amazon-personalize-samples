    "# Amazon Personalize: using item metadata to identify stronger similarities\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevance of the recommendations you deliver with Amazon Personalize depends on the data available when the recommendations are generated. Amazon Personalize uses your users’ historical interactions, the attributes of your items, and your users’ metadata to learn what items are most relevant for each user. The primary data required by Amazon Personalize is user-item interactions. The interactions users have with items in your catalog, such as clicking on a product, reading an article, watching a video, or purchasing a product, are an important signal of what they have found relevant in the past. Including item and user attributes, also known as metadata, can enhance the relevance of recommendations; especially for new items that are similar to what your users have found relevant. However, structured metadata such as an item’s category, style, or genre may not always be readily available or doesn’t provide all the information that you have in your narrative descriptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now Amazon Personalize allows you to add item metadata such as product descriptions, genre of a movie, etc.. Amazon Personalize hosts, manages, and automatically processes your item metadata attributes and use it to improve the performance of your Amazon Personalize related items solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how the new recipe `aws-similar-items` plus item metadata improves the relevance of recommendations compared to the `SIMS` recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Reviews data from the Amazon Prime Pantry category are used for the interactions and items datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering including text in your items dataset, keep the following best practices in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "One dataset group will be created that will include the interactions data plus item metadata this way we can train two separate models and compare their offline and online results."

The `asin` column is our unique identifier for each item (although there looks to be one duplicate) and `brand` and `price` look like they may be useful. The `description` column is what we will use for unstructured text.\n",

Lastly, the `description` values also contain HTML markup that needs to stripped.\n",
