    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to walk through the process for *updating* your *item schema* when using Amazon Personalize in the context of *User Segmentation* use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is inspired by the official AWS [Retail Demo Store Workshop](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store). The main difference between this notebook and the Retail Demo Store workshop, is that the latter mainly focuses on real-time recommendations, whereas this notebook demonstrates how to implement item schema updates for batch segmentation jobs, specifially for solutions that use the item-attribute-affinity recipe. Though the teachings in this notebook apply to the other recipe types as well.\n",

    "- This notebook was developed and tested in the us-east-1 Region.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To ensure a reliable run, please don't *concurrently* run multiple copies of this notebook on the same Sagemaker Notebook Instance. If you want to concurrently run multiple copies of this notebook, run each notebook in its own environment/instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- After you finish running this notebook, please run the code cells in the `Clean up` chapter of this notebook (final chapter). This will prevent incurring additional costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate a high-level implementation of an end-to-end Personalize Workflow for schema updates. As such, the code within this notebook has not been tested for a production environment and for the sake of brevity, not all security best practices may have been implemented. For additional information to secure your Personalize-dependent workloads, refer to the [Security in Amazon Personalize](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/security.html) section of the Amazon Personalize documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The notebook will be using the python programming language and the AWS SDK for python (referred to as boto3). Even if you are not fluent in python, the code cells should be reasonably intuitive. In practice, you can use any programming language supported by the AWS SDK to complete the same steps from this notebook in your application environment. Visit the [official boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) for more information about the AWS SDK for Python.\n"

    "## Introduction to Amazon Personalize\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/) makes it easy for customers to develop applications with a wide array of personalization use cases, including real time product recommendations and customized direct marketing. Amazon Personalize brings the same machine learning technology used by Amazon.com to everyone for use in their applications – with no machine learning experience required. Amazon Personalize customers pay for what they use, with no minimum fees or upfront commitment. You can start using Amazon Personalize with a simple three step process, which only takes a few clicks in the AWS console, or a set of simple API calls. First, point Amazon Personalize to user data, catalog data, and activity stream of views, clicks, purchases, etc. in Amazon S3 or upload using a simple API call. Second, with a single click in the console or an API call, train a custom private recommendation model for your data. Third, retrieve personalized recommendations for any user by creating a recommender, campaign, or batch job.\n"

    "Amazon Personalize provides predefined recipes, based on common use cases, for training models. A recipe is a machine learning algorithm that you use with settings, or hyperparameters, and the data you provide to train an Amazon Personalize model. The data you provide to train a model are organized into separate datasets by the type of data being provided. A collection of datasets are organized into a dataset group. The three dataset types supported by Personalize are items, users, and interactions. Depending on the recipe type you choose, a different combination of dataset types are required. For all recipe types, an interactions dataset is required. Interactions represent how users interact with items. For example, viewing a product, watching a video, listening to a recording, or reading an article. In this notebook, we will be using the item-attribute-affinity recipe, a recipe that supports all three dataset types.\n",

Personalize will automatically apply a natural language processing (NLP) machine learning model to the product description column to extract features from the text. The product's unique identifier is required. For items, at least one metadata column (such as price or level-1 category) is also required. In the first part of this notebook, we will create a model that only uses the `ITEM_ID`, `PRICE`, `CATEGORY_L1` columns.

    "### Create Schemas for Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Personalize requires a schema for each dataset so it can map the columns in our CSVs to fields for model training. Each schema is declared in JSON using the [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define and create schemas in Personalize for our datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that categorical fields include an additional attribute of `\"categorical\": true` and the textual field has an additional attribute of `\"textual\": true`. Categorical fields are those where one or more values can be specified for the field value (i.e. enumerated values). For example, one or more category names/codes for the `CATEGORY_L1` field. A textual field indicates that Personalize should apply a natural language processing (NLP) model to the field's value to extract model features from unstructured text. In this case, we're using the product description as the textual field. You can only have one textual field in the items dataset. Finally, you will notice that the `PROMOTED` field does _not_ have `categorical` or `textual` specified. In this case, the `PROMOTED` column will not be included as a feature in the model but can be used for filtering (out of scope of this notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another detail to note is that when we call the [CreateSchema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateSchema.html) API, we pass an optional `domain` parameter with a value of `ECOMMERCE`. This tells Personalize that we are creating a schema for Retail/E-commerce domain. We will do this for all three schemas."

The new columns will then be available for filtering. To use the new columns for training, simply clone your existing Solution, select the new columns for training, and train a new Solution version.\n",

    "This demonstration required some set up. To recap those steps, we:\n",
    "1. Set Up Amazon S3 Bucket, IAM Policies, and IAM Roles\n",
    "2. Fetched and Inspect the Datasets\n",
    "3. Created Schemas and Imported Datasets in Amazon Personalize\n",
    "4. Created an e-commerce custom solution in Amazon Personalize\n",
    "5. Ran a Batch Segmentation Job our Solution Version to obtain a baseline for comparison.\n",

    "To Recap, the steps we performed for updating a schema, we:\n",
    "1. Updated the schema (via the CreateSchema API)\n",
    "2. Updated the dataset that corresponded to the updated schema (via the UpdateDataset API)\n",
    "3. Imported our new data/columns (via the CreateDatasetImportJob API)\n",
    "4. Created new a Solution (via the CreateSolution API).\n",
    "5. Trained a new solution version (via the CreateSolutionVersion API) that uses updated schema and new dataset.\n",
    "6. Submited the batch job to our new solution version.\n",
    "7. Inspected the output of our job & compared it to the output from the original solution version.\n",
    "8. Compared the before-and-after metrics of the two solution versions\n",
