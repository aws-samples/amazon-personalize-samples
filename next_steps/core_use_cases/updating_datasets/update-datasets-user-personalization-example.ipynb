    "## Guided Example for Adding New Items and Interactions for User-Personalization Solutions in Amazon Personalize\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains the process for *updating* your *datasets* when using Amazon Personalize--specifically adding new *items* and *interactions for those new items*. Commentary in this notebook is centered around the *User Personalization* recipe. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is inspired by the official AWS [Retail Demo Store Workshop](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store). The main difference between this notebook and the Retail Demo Store workshop, is that the latter mainly focuses on real-time recommendations, whereas this notebook demonstrates how updating your datasets affects user-personalization solutions & item recommendations.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Notebook overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core content:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can demonstrate schema changes, we will need to do some set-up. This set up portion is documented in the first 5 chapters of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we perform the set up, we will then walk through the process of changing your dataset. \n",
    "This is what the remaining chapters go over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table of Contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "------------Set up------------\n",
    "- **Chapter 1**: Set Up Amazon S3 Bucket, IAM Policies, and IAM Roles (_5 minutes_)\n",
    "- **Chapter 2**: Fetch, Inspect, and Trim the Datasets (_5 minutes_)\n",
    "- **Chapter 3**: Create Schemas and Import Datasets in Amazon Personalize (_15 minutes_)\n",
    "- **Chapter 4**: Create an e-commerce custom solution in Amazon Personalize (_60 minutes_)\n",
    "- **Chapter 5**: Gather Metrics and Run a Batch Inference Job on your Solution Version (_20 minutes_)\n",
    "\n",
    "------------Updating Datasets------------\n",
    "- **Chapter 6**: Overview of the Steps involved for your Updating Datasets for User-Personalization Solutions (_100 minutes_)\n",
    "- **Chapter 6 Step 1**: Fetch, modify, and inspect the updated the Items & Interactions Datasets \n",
    "- **Chapter 6 Step 2**: Update the Items & Interactions Datasets (via the the CreateDatasetImportJob API)\n",
    "- **Chapter 6 Step 3**: Re-Run the Batch Inference Job on your Solution Version to trigger an auto-update\n",
    "- **Chapter 6 Step 4**: Gather metrics of the auto-updated solution version\n",
    "- **Chapter 6 Step 5**: Perform A Full Retraining (Create a Solution Version)\n",
    "- **Chapter 6 Step 6**: Run the Batch Inference Job on the new Solution Version\n",
    "- **Chapter 6 Step 7**: Gather metrics of the fully-retrained solution version\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "------------Analysis------------\n",
    "- **Chapter 7**: Analysis (_5 minutes_)\n",
    "- **Chapter 7 Step 1**: Compare the outputs of the original, auto-updated, and fully retrained solution versions. \n",
    "    - All three should be different.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Chapter 7 Step 2**: Compare the metrics across the two solution versions (original, auto-updated, fully-trained)\n",
    "    - Since the solution version was fully retrained with additional data, we should expect the metrics to be slightly different.\n",
    "    \n",
    "------------Clean up------------\n",
    "- **Chapter 8**: Clean up (_15 minutes_)\n",

    "#### Relevant Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook was developed and tested in the us-east-1 Region.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To ensure a reliable run, please don't *concurrently* run multiple copies of this notebook on the same Sagemaker Notebook Instance. If you want to concurrently run multiple copies of this notebook, run each notebook in its own environment/instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Updating datasets for user-segmentation-based solutions is similar. The difference is, for user-segmentation, a new solution version *must* be trained before changes in the datasets have an impact in your recommendations. This is in contrast to user-personalization-based solutions, where recent interactions and new items are factored in your inference jobs. This is useful for \"cold\"-starting new items. However, to use those new items & interactions beyond cold starts, occasionally training a new solution version is recommended. This will make that new data more impactful in your recommendations for user-personalization solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After you finish running this notebook, please run the code cells in the `Clean up` chapter of this notebook (final chapter). This will prevent incurring additional costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate a *high-level* implementation of an end-to-end Personalize Workflow for updating datasets. As such, the code within this notebook has not been tested for a production environment and for the sake of brevity, not all security best practices may have been implemented. For additional information to secure your Personalize-dependent workloads, refer to the [Security in Amazon Personalize](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/security.html) section of the Amazon Personalize documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook will be using the python programming language and the AWS SDK for python (referred to as boto3). Even if you are not fluent in python, the code cells should be reasonably intuitive. In practice, you can use any programming language supported by the AWS SDK to complete the same steps from this notebook in your application environment. Visit the [official boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) for more information about the AWS SDK for Python.\n"

    "## Introduction to Amazon Personalize\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/) makes it easy for customers to develop applications with a wide array of personalization use cases, including real time product recommendations and customized direct marketing. Amazon Personalize brings the same machine learning technology used by Amazon.com to everyone for use in their applications – with no machine learning experience required. Amazon Personalize customers pay for what they use, with no minimum fees or upfront commitment. You can start using Amazon Personalize with a simple three step process, which only takes a few clicks in the AWS console, or a set of simple API calls. First, point Amazon Personalize to user data, catalog data, and activity stream of views, clicks, purchases, etc. in Amazon S3 or upload using a simple API call. Second, with a single click in the console or an API call, train a custom private recommendation model for your data. Third, retrieve personalized recommendations for any user by creating a recommender, campaign, or batch job.\n"

A recipe is a machine learning algorithm that you use with settings, or hyperparameters, and the data you provide to train an Amazon Personalize model. The data you provide to train a model are organized into separate datasets by the type of data being provided. A collection of datasets are organized into a dataset group. The three dataset types supported by Personalize are items, users, and interactions. Depending on the recipe type you choose, a different combination of dataset types are required. For all recipe types, an interactions dataset is required. Interactions represent how users interact with items. For example, viewing a product, watching a video, listening to a recording, or reading an article.

    "\n",
    "Amazon Personalize requires a schema for each dataset so it can map the columns in our CSVs to fields for model training. Each schema is declared in JSON using the [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define and create schemas in Personalize for our datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that categorical fields include an additional attribute of `\"categorical\": true` and the textual field has an additional attribute of `\"textual\": true`. Categorical fields are those where one or more values can be specified for the field value (i.e. enumerated values). For example, one or more category names/codes for the `CATEGORY_L1` field. A textual field indicates that Personalize should apply a natural language processing (NLP) model to the field's value to extract model features from unstructured text. In this case, we're using the product description as the textual field. You can only have one textual field in the items dataset. Finally, you will notice that the `PROMOTED` field does _not_ have `categorical` or `textual` specified. In this case, the `PROMOTED` column will not be included as a feature in the model but can be used for filtering (out of scope of this notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another detail to note is that when we call the [CreateSchema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateSchema.html) API, we pass an optional `domain` parameter with a value of `ECOMMERCE`. This tells Personalize that we are creating a schema for Retail/E-commerce domain. We will do this for all three schemas."

And it uses any new *interactions* data, including impressions data, to determine *what items to include or not include in exploration*. This is *not* a full retraining; you should still train a new solution version weekly with trainingMode set to FULL so the model can learn from your users' behavior and any item metadata.\n",
