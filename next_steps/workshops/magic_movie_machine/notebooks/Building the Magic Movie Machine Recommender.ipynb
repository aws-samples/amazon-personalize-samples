    "# Building the Magic Movie Machine Recommender\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to build your own version of the Magic Movie Machine in your AWS account. In this Jupyter notebook,\n",
    "you will see how you can create recommenders that generate recommendations just as in the Magic Movie Machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will first download, modify, and import the movie data collected from the [MovieLens project](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) data set into Amazon Personalize. Then you will have Amazon Personalize use this data to create recommenders, one for the *Top picks for you* use case and one for the *More like X* use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are pre-configured use cases that generate recommendations. Behind the scenes, Amazon Personalize trains multiple use case specific models for each recommender. *Top picks for you* generates recommendations similar to the Top recommendations you saw in the Magic Movie Machine. *More like X* is a simpler version of the *Hidden gems* recommendations: It generates recommendations for similar movies, but they are not lesser known gems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will get movie recommendations, just like what you saw in the Magic Movie Machine!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Cost and Duration\n",
    "This tutorial can take around 2 hours to complete. Depending on your AWS account, you might incur some cost. If you are using the AWS free tier, complete the tutorial in the same day that you start, and delete any resources upon completion, these costs will be mimimal to none.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, make sure to run the `Clean_Up_Resources.ipynb` notebook found in this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to Use the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is broken up into cells like the one below. There's a triangular Run button at the top of this page that you can click to execute each cell and move onto the next, or you can press `Shift` + `Enter` while in the cell to execute it and move onto the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a cell is executing you'll notice a line to the side showcase an `*` while the cell is running or it will update to a number to indicate the last cell that completed executing after it has finished exectuting all the code within a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply follow the instructions below and execute the cells to get started with Amazon Personalize using case optimized recommenders."
