This metric is appropriate if you're interested in the single highest ranked recommendation.\n",

Therefore, each recommendation is discounted (given a lower weight) by a factor dependent on its position. To produce the [cumulative discounted gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain) (DCG) at K, each relevant discounted recommendation in the top K recommendations is summed together. The normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) is the DCG divided by the ideal DCG such that NDCG is between 0 - 1. (The ideal DCG is where the top K recommendations are sorted by relevance.) Amazon Personalize uses a weighting factor of 1/log(1 + position), where the top of the list is position 1. This metric rewards relevant items that appear near the top of the list, because the top of a list usually draws more attention.\n",

A campaign is a hosted solution version; an endpoint which you can query for recommendations. Pricing is set by estimating throughput capacity (requests from users for personalization per second). When deploying a campaign, you set a minimum transactions per second (TPS) value (`minProvisionedTPS`). This service, like many within AWS, will automatically scale based on demand, but if latency is critical, you may want to provision ahead for larger demand. For this demo, the minimum throughput threshold is set to 1. For more information, see the [pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/) page.\n",

    "As mentioned above, the user-personalization recipe used for our solution supports automatic exploration of \"cold\" items. You can control how much exploration is performed when creating your campaign. The `itemExplorationConfig` data type supports `explorationWeight` and `explorationItemAgeCutOff` parameters. Exploration weight determines how frequently recommendations include items with less interactions data or relevance. The closer the value is to 1.0, the more exploration. At zero, no exploration occurs and recommendations are based on current data (relevance). Exploration item age cut-off determines items to be explored based on time frame since latest interaction. Provide the maximum item age, in days since the latest interaction, to define the scope of item exploration. The larger the value, the more items are considered during exploration. For our campaign below, we'll specify an exploration weight of 0.5."
