1. `1.Building_Your_First_Campaign.ipynb`  - Guides you through building your first campaign and recommendation algorithm. 
2. `2.View_Campaign_And_Interactions.ipynb` - Showcase how to generate a recommendation and how to modify it with real time intent. 
3. `3.Best_Practices-Clientside.ipynb` - Guides you to implement best practices.
