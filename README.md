# Amazon Personalize Samples

This repository contains a collection of notebooks and examples to help you learn how to utilize Amazon Personalize. It begins with a CloudFormation template that deploys an S3 bucket, IAM Role, and SageMaker Notebook instance in order to execute the demos and to act as a getting started guide for a POC.

To get started with the initial lab and to familiarize yourself with the service open the `getting_started` folder and follow the README.md file inside. A full agenda is provided there explaining how to progress from notebook to notebook.

For more complex examples, explore the `advanced_notebooks` folder. It currently contains a deep dive on diagnosing issues with your datasets and an example of holding out part of your interaction data to determine the impact of your recommendation model.
